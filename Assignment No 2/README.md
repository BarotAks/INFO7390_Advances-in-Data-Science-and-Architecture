# Logistic Regression Neural Network Implementation

## Overview

This repository showcases our implementation of a logistic regression unit as a single neuron neural network using Python within a Jupyter notebook. We integrated the Log Loss Function and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimization. Additionally, we explored replacing the sigmoid activation function with ReLU and tan functions. The assignment also involved applying the unit to a classification problem using a titanic dataset and evaluating its performance through accuracy and F1 score metrics.

## Implementation Details

- Logistic regression unit with Log Loss Function and SGD optimization.
- Exploration of ReLU and tan activation functions.
- Application on a classification problem with titanic dataset.
- Evaluation using accuracy and F1 score metrics.

This assignment enabled us to implement a logistic regression unit as a neural network, deepening our understanding of neural network concepts and optimization methods like SGD. Exploring activation function variations and applying the model to a dataset highlighted practical implications. The assignment's emphasis on model evaluation expanded our familiarity with key performance metrics, providing a holistic view of neural network application and assessment.
