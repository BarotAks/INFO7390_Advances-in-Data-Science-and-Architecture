# Assignment No 1
## K-Means Clustering Algorithm Implementation 

## Overview

This assignment required us to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm using Python within a Jupyter notebook. The primary objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the K-Means algorithm and its application to real-world data. We were given the option to choose our dataset or use the provided Online Retail dataset. The key tasks involved in this assignment were:

1. Implement the K-Means algorithm from scratch without using any machine learning libraries.
2. Apply the algorithm to the chosen dataset and perform clustering.
3. Visualize the clusters and results using a suitable plotting mechanism.
4. Demonstrate our understanding of each step of the implemented algorithm through code review.

This assignment not only helped us reinforce our understanding of K-Means clustering but also allowed us to develop hands-on coding skills and data visualization capabilities. Through this implementation, we were able to gain insights into the challenges and nuances of unsupervised learning and clustering techniques.
